Guess the country is basic guessing game made using Python. The game is based on guessing the country using the silhouttes with a total of 5 guesses and a hint after every guess about the direction of the country and distance from the country you guessed

Note: The game is based on Mercator projection so the distance is calculated using Pythagoras formula(Flat Surface distance) and not using Haversine formula(Curved SUrface Distance)
